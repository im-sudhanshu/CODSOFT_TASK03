## Project Structure

```
CODSOFT_TASK03/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
```
2. Open the `CODSOFT_TASK03` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (or use VS Code Live Server).

No installation or build step is required.

## How It Works

- Tasks are stored as an array of objects: `{ id, text, done }`.
- Every add, edit, delete, or toggle calls `save()`, which writes the array to `localStorage` with `JSON.stringify`.
- On page load, the array is restored with `JSON.parse`.
- `render()` rebuilds the list from the array, applying the search text and the selected filter.
